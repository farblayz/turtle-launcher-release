# Turtle WoW Launcher
This project is made for Turtle WoW Private Server.
It is a World of Warcraft launcher application with some built-in quality of life features.

These are:
* Download and install Turtle WoW client
* On launch, sets the realmlist to the Turtle WoW server's login address
* You can easily clean WDB folder with one click
* Direct link to website
* [OPTION] Auto-Launch World of Warcraft when the application starts
* [OPTION] Auto-Clear WDB folder when WoW launches

Please note that, this application is in beta-phase, so there can be bugs.
If you happen to find any, please report it in the Issue Tracker or contact me at the Turtle WoW Discord server, or on the Turtle WoW forums via PM.

You can download the binaries package from the Releases section.

## Install:
1. [Download the latest installer](https://github.com/farblayz/turtle-launcher-release/releases) from the Releases section (to the right)
2. Choose the installation folder (it doesn't have to be your WoW folder)  -  Note: at the moment, installing in Program Files is not supported.
3. Launch the application

## First start
1. On your first start, the settings window will appear
2. Browse the folder where you want to install the client (WoW.exe will be in this folder)

    NOTE: If you already have Turtle WoW Client installed, you can browse to that folder and the launcher can be used right away
3. You can optionally check if you want to launch WoW immediately after opening the application
4. You also have an option to clear the cache (WDB) folder on every WoW launch. These two options can be combined together
5. Click the Save button and you are good to go, switch to the main window by clicking on the "Back" button in the top left corner

## Downloading the client
* After you're done with the setup and set WoW directory to one that doesn't contain WoW.exe, you have to download the client by clicking on the first button.
* The download starts and when it is finished the unpacking of the client will start
* When the installation is finished, the status messages will disappear and the "Download Client" button will be switched to the "Launch" button

## Bugs and issues
Please, if you happen to run into any issues or discover a bug, report it to the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/farblayz/turtle-launcher-release/issues) here in the repository or contact me on Turtle WoW Discord or on the forums via PM.
